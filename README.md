# A collection of regular expressions for validating user inputs. (Nigeria).

### Current regex supported: 
+ matching Nigerian phone numbers.
+ matching emails. 
+ matching names (compound names supported too!)
+ matching Nigerian zipcodes. 

I will be updating the [`regex.js`](#) file when I write regex to match to match common patterns. Feel free to open issues or contribute. I accept pull requests too!  :)
